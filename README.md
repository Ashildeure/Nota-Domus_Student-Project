# NotaDomus - Web Application for French Heritage  

## 🚀 About the Project  
**NotaDomus** is a web application created as part of a first-semester project of the second year in the BUT Informatique program. This platform aims to promote and celebrate French heritage by providing users with an interactive map to explore houses labeled as "Maisons des Illustres."  

Developed by a team of seven students, we followed the **Scrum methodology** to manage our workflow effectively and deliver a well-rounded, user-friendly application.  

NotaDomus allows users to navigate through the different "Maisons des Illustres" scattered across France. These are primarily buildings with historical significance related to artists, authors, inventors, and other prominent figures.  

### 🌟 Features  
- **Interactive Map**:  
  - Utilizes the Google Maps API to provide an engaging way to explore the locations.  
  - Filter houses and select them using a side panel for easy navigation.  
- **Search Functionality**:  
  - Search by keywords such as the name of the notable person associated with the house or even their works.  
- **Social Features**:  
  - Manage a friends list: add or remove friends.  
  - Engage with friends by viewing their activity.  
- **Heritage Exploration**:  
  - Get detailed information about each house, including its history, associated personalities, and works.  

### 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Google Maps API** for interactive map rendering  
- **MVC Architecture**  
- **Scrum Methodology** for team collaboration  

## 🌍 Purpose and Vision  
The project combines cultural education with social interaction, allowing users to explore, learn, and connect while preserving and promoting French heritage.  

## 🌟 Learning Outcomes  
This project helped us:  
- Master the integration of APIs (Google Maps).  
- Implement a clean and modular **MVC architecture**.  
- Develop full-stack web application skills.  
- Collaborate efficiently in a team of seven using **Scrum** (e.g., sprint planning, stand-ups, retrospectives).  
- Manage and display dynamic data such as filters, social interactions, and search results.  

## 💡 Next Steps  
If we revisit this project, we’d like to:  
- Enhance the social features (e.g., messaging between friends).
- Integrate additional accessibility features for inclusivity.
